    * @see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17.
    *      Use this property if you want to upload plaintext to S3. The content type will be set to 'text/plain' automatically.
    * @param acl                     The canned ACL (Access Control List) to apply to the object. For more information
    *                                If the service returns an enum value that is not available in the current SDK version, acl will return ObjectCannedACL.UNKNOWN_TO_SDK_VERSION.
    *                                The raw value returned by the service is available from aclAsString().
    * @param grantFullControl        Gives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object.
    * @param grantRead               Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.
    * @param grantReadACP            Allows grantee to read the object ACL.
    * @param grantWriteACP           Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.
    * @param requestPayer            Returns the value of the RequestPayer property for this object.
    * @param serverSideEncryption    The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).
    * @param sseCustomerAlgorithm    Specifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).
    * @param sseCustomerKey          Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data.
    * @param sseCustomerKeyMD5       Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321.
    * @param ssekmsEncryptionContext Specifies the AWS KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption.
    * @param ssekmsKeyId             If [[serverSideEncryption]] is present and has the value of aws:kms, this header specifies the ID of the
    *                                AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) symmetrical customer managed customer master key (CMK) that was used for the object.
    * @param s3Client                An implicit instance of [[S3AsyncClient]].
    * @param scheduler               An implicit instance monix [[Scheduler]].
    * @return The response from the put object http request as [[PutObjectResponse]].
